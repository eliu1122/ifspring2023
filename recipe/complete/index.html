                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="h2">In the old days, eating meat was often a luxury. How does one feed an entire family in the rare
                    moment one has a small piece of pork to work with? You cut it into small pieces, braise it for a
                    long time to create a savory braised meat sauce thatâ€™s bursting with flavor, and mix it with lots of
                    steaming, comforting rice so the whole family can enjoy it. Nowadays, it is one of the most beloved
                    Taiwanese dish.

                <h2>Equipments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pot</li>
                    <li>Spoon to stir the meat</li>
                    <li>Bowl</li>
                    <li>Rice cooker</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (just enough so that the pork will be fully submerged),
                        and blanch the chopped pork belly for 1 minute. Drain, rinse clean of any scum, and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a wok over low heat, and add the sugar. Cook the sugar until it starts to melt
                        and then add the onions. Turn up the heat to medium high and stir-fry the onions for a minute.
                        Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for another couple minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the blanched pork, shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce and water. Stir and bring
                        the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, add the spices (which should be tied in cheese cloth),
                        along with the peeled hardboiled eggs and turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 1 1/2
                        hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>At this point the meat should be fall-apart tender. To finish the dish, remove the spice packet
                        and turn up the heat to medium high to thicken the sauce, stirring occasionally. This process
                        should take about 5-minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon, but there should
                        still be plenty of it left. Serve over steamed white rice.
                    </li>
                </ol>
