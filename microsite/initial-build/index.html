            The following description refers mainly to the external anatomy of the common European shrimp, Crangon
            crangon, as a typical example of a decapod shrimp. The body of the shrimp is divided into two main parts:
            the head and thorax which are fused together to form the cephalothorax, and a long narrow abdomen.
            <br>
            <br>
            The shell which protects the cephalothorax is harder and thicker than the shell elsewhere on the shrimp and
            is called
            the carapace. The carapace typically surrounds the gills, through which water is pumped by the action of the
            mouthparts. The rostrum, eyes, whiskers and legs also issue from the carapace. The rostrum, from the
            Latin r≈çstrum meaning beak, looks like a beak or pointed nose at the front of the shrimp's head. It is a
            rigid forward extension of the carapace and can be used for attack or defense. It may also stabilize the
            shrimp when it swims backward.
            <br>
            <br>
            Two bulbous eyes on stalks sit either side of the rostrum. These are compound
            eyes which have panoramic vision and are very good at detecting movement. Two pairs of whiskers (antennae)
            also issue from the head. One of these pairs is very long and can be twice the length of the shrimp, while
            the other pair is quite short. The antennae have sensors on them which allow the shrimp to feel where they
            touch, and also allow them to "smell" or "taste" things by sampling the chemicals in the water. The long
            antennae help the shrimp orient itself with regard to its immediate surroundings, while the short antennae
            help assess the suitability of prey

            Shrimp are widespread, and can be found near the seafloor of most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers
            and lakes. There are numerous species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat.
            Most shrimp species are marine, although about a quarter of the described species are found in fresh
            water. Marine species are found at depths of up to 5,000 metres (16,000 ft), and from the tropics to
            the polar regions. Although shrimp are almost entirely fully aquatic, the two species of Merguia are
            semi-terrestrial and spend a significant part of their life on land in mangrove.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most shrimp are omnivorous, but some are specialised for particular modes of feeding. Some are filter
            feeders, using their setose (bristly) legs as a sieve; some scrape algae from rocks. Cleaner shrimp feed on
            the parasites and necrotic tissue of the reef fish they groom. Some species of shrimp are known to
            cannibalize others as well if other food sources are not readily available. In turn, shrimp are eaten by
            various animals, particularly fish and seabirds, and frequently host bopyrid parasites.

            There are many variations in the ways different types of shrimp look and behave. Even within the core group
            of caridean shrimp, the small delicate Pederson's shrimp looks and behaves quite unlike the large
            commercial pink shrimp or the snapping pistol shrimp.
            <br>
            <br>
            The caridean family of pistol shrimp are
            characterized by big asymmetrical claws, the larger of which can produce a loud snapping sound. The family
            is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 600 species. Colonies of snapping shrimp
            are a major source of noise in the ocean and can interfere with sonar and underwater
            communication. The small emperor shrimp has a symbiotic relationship with sea slugs and sea
            cucumbers, and may help keep them clear of ectoparasites
            <br>
            <br>
            Females of the freshwater shrimp Caridina ensifera are capable of storing sperm from multiple partners, and
            thus can produce progeny with different paternities. Reproductive success of sires was found to
            correlate inversely with their genetic relatedness to the mother.[ This finding suggests that sperm
            competition and/or pre- and post-copulatory female choice occurs. Female choice may increase the fitness of
            progeny by reducing inbreeding depression that ordinarily results from the expression of homozygous
            deleterious recessive mutations.[

            There is little agreement among taxonomists concerning the phylogeny of crustaceans. Within the decapods
            "every study gives totally different results. Nor do even one of these studies match any of the rival
            morphology studies". Some taxonomists identify shrimp with the infraorder Caridea and prawns with the
            suborder Dendrobranchiata. While different experts give different answers, there is no disagreement that
            the caridean species are shrimp. There are over 3000 caridean species. Occasionally they are referred
            to as "true shrimp".
            <br>
            <br>
            Traditionally decapods were divided into two suborders: the Natantia (or swimmers), and the Reptantia (or
            walkers). The Natantia or swimmers included the shrimp. They were defined by their abdomen which, together
            with its appendages was well adapted for swimming. The Reptantia or walkers included the crabs and lobsters.
            These species have small abdominal appendages, but robust legs well adapted for walking. The Natantia was
            thought to be paraphyletic, that is, it was thought that originally all decapods were like shrimp.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, classifications are now based on clades, and the paraphyletic suborder Natantia has been
            discontinued. "On this basis, taxonomic classifications now divide the order Decapoda into the two
            suborders: Dendrobranchiata for the largest shrimp clade, and Pleocyemata for all other decapods. The
            Pleocyemata are in turn divided into half a dozen infra-orders"[
