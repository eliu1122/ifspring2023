            The following description refers mainly to the external anatomy of the common European shrimp, Crangon
            crangon, as a typical example of a decapod shrimp. The body of the shrimp is divided into two main parts:
            the head and thorax which are fused together to form the cephalothorax, and a long narrow abdomen.
            <br>
            <br>
            The shell which protects the cephalothorax is harder and thicker than the shell elsewhere on the shrimp and is called
            the carapace. The carapace typically surrounds the gills, through which water is pumped by the action of the
            mouthparts. The rostrum, eyes, whiskers and legs also issue from the carapace. The rostrum, from the
            Latin rōstrum meaning beak, looks like a beak or pointed nose at the front of the shrimp's head. It is a
            rigid forward extension of the carapace and can be used for attack or defense. It may also stabilize the
            shrimp when it swims backward. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Two bulbous eyes on stalks sit either side of the rostrum. These are compound
            eyes which have panoramic vision and are very good at detecting movement. Two pairs of whiskers (antennae)
            also issue from the head. One of these pairs is very long and can be twice the length of the shrimp, while
            the other pair is quite short. The antennae have sensors on them which allow the shrimp to feel where they
            touch, and also allow them to "smell" or "taste" things by sampling the chemicals in the water. The long
            antennae help the shrimp orient itself with regard to its immediate surroundings, while the short antennae
            help assess the suitability of prey
