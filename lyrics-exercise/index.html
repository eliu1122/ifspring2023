    <h1>Fireflies - Owl City</h1>
    <div>
        You, my friend, you're a lot like them<br>
        But I caught your lie, and you know I did<br>
        Now I'm lost in you like I always do<br>
        And I'd die to win 'cause I'm born to lose<br>
        Firefly, could you shine your light?<br>
        Now I know your ways 'cause they're just like mine<br>
        Now I'm justified as I fall in line<br>
        And it's hard to try when you're open wide<br>
        Take my hand, we'll be off, and then<br>
        We'll come back again to a different land<br>
        Now I like this way, you can go away<br>
        If you guess the name you cannot replace<br>
        Firefly, could you shine your light?<br>
        Now I know your ways 'cause they're just like mine<br>
        Now I'm justified as I fall in line<br>
        And it's hard to try when you're open wide<br>
        Bring me your enemies<br>
        Lay them before me<br>
        And walk away<br>
        Walk away<br>
        Walk away<br>
        Firefly, could you shine your light?<br>
        Now I know your ways 'cause they're just like mine<br>
        Now I'm justified as I fall in line<br>
        And it's hard to try when you're open wide<br>
        F*** you, firefly, have you lost your light?<br>
        Now I hate your ways 'cause they're just like mine<br>
        So you've lost, my friend, such a sorry end<br>
        And I don't know why, so I choke and smile<br>
        Smile<br>
    </div>
